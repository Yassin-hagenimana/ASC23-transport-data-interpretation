This project analyzes transport data focused on vehicle fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions. 
Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is visualized through histograms and a correlation heatmap. 
The analysis helps identify patterns in engine size, fuel consumption, emissions....
